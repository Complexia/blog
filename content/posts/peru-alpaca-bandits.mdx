As with all things, once we try something once, it´s never enough. And I´ve been stuck in Peru for far too long now. Firstly in Lima, then in Cusco because of protests, then again in Lima, and in my opinion, being stuck in any city in Peru for more than a week is far too long (with the possible exception of Cusco, which is really nice), so I found myself sitting in the common area of a backpackers hostel, thinking on my next move.

Brazil, I thought. I wanted to go to Brazil. Spending some time on Google Maps, I learned that the most fun way to get there from Lima would be to go to Yurimaguas, take a cargo boat to Iquitos, and then one from Iquitos all the way to Manaus in Brazil. As I mused on the idea, I liked it more and more. I was going to take a bus to Tarapoto, go to Yurimaguas, and leave Peru behind me. I was thinking of resuming hitchhiking once I had arrived in Brazil.

In retrospect to all of this, it would have been a lot more economical to take a bus. While overall it was still an amazing experience shared with a now really good friend, I personally put my seal of disapproval on hitchhiking in Peru. The people don´t seem to understand the concept. Even normal drivers (of which there are not many outside of the coast area) expect you to pay them after the ride, making things really awkward. "For gasoline," they say. And outside of the coast, on roads that I and my friend took, the only existing traffic is taxis. Everybody who can afford to buy any sort of vehicle is a taxi driver. And they all expect you to pay, taking away from the experience.

So anyhow, this is how it went.

I found myself seated in the common area of the hostel, contemplating taking a bus to Tarapoto the next day. A newfound friend I met here, Johnny Outsider, a fellow traveler, shared his remarkable journey biking to Peru from Ecuador. After his bike succumbed somewhere in the northern deserts of Peru, he hitchhiked his way to Lima. His plan was to purchase another bike and continue through Bolivia and Argentina, eventually reaching Buenos Aires for his flight back to South Africa.

Quickly, I proposed an alternative to Johnny.

- Why don´t we go to Brazil instead, and then you can continue your cycling on the other side of the continent? - I suggested.

After a moment's thought, he agreed. Naturally, I'm not the kind of person to suggest anyone take a bus. So, the next day, we set off hitchhiking to Tarapoto.

The first challenge was to escape Lima. It's a massive city with unfathomable traffic, probably the most congested I've ever experienced, even compared to Los Angeles. Believe me, compared to Lima, LA is heaven. After walking for nearly two hours, dealing with a fat guy having his shoes polished who swore at us with probably the only four English words he knew (my friend, faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaark youuuuuuuuu), looking like he was about to burst from rage, and successfully deflecting a pickpocket who went for a bunch of used tissue, we finally reached the freeway.

Initially, I thought of walking along the emergency lane. But seeing there wasn't any emergency lane, and realizing that around 80% of the traffic consisted of buses (with the remaining 20% probably being taxis), hitching from the center of this city was out of the question. Eventually, we took a local bus that transported us to the outskirts of Lima, where the Pan-American Highway stretched northward as far as north goes.

Our plan was set to head to Huaura, about 100 kilometers away from Lima, and then take the Ruta 18 eastward toward the city of Sayan. The day's first ride was a bit unexpected—a taxi. It turned out to be a couple heading home and generously offered us a lift for around 20 kilometers. They were incredibly friendly, and it was a fantastic start to the day. Surprisingly, they didn't ask for payment, a rare occurrence we didn't expect to repeat.

The subsequent ride became the highlight of our entire journey. It was a semi-pickup truck, and the driver was some kind of supplier for engineers and builders, returning home from Lima fully loaded with supplies. He stopped at a local restaurant and treated us to food. This guy was genuinely amazing. He took us all the way to Huaura. We thanked him immensely as we continued our journey. Now, we were about to venture onto Ruta 18, a smaller road heading east. Although there was some traffic, it mainly seemed to consist of taxi-vans marked with "Sayan" on their front windows. I can't recall precisely whom we hitched with to get to Sayan, but I'm certain we hadn't encountered these taxi-vans at this point. That was a story for later.

The first leg of our journey had been exceptional. Upon reaching Sayan, a town nestled beside beautiful rocky mountains on one side and a river on the other, we decided to take a break. Finding a shaded spot, I pulled out my harmonica, a recent purchase from Lima, and played intermittently while soaking in the tranquility of the surroundings. John suggested camping here for the night—it was only just past 2 PM. With no rush, we agreed. 

Climbing the steep mountain with our backpacks took about an hour, navigating unsteady rocks that slipped beneath our feet. Finally, we found a perfect clearing in a ravine, overlooking the entire valley where Sayan was situated. This became our campsite. We made a second trip down for firewood, during which I managed to fall on my backside and rip my favorite pants—a true tragedy. Despite that mishap, the evening campfire atop the mountain, with its breathtaking view and serene atmosphere, made it all worthwhile.

Can it really get more beautiful than this?

The next morning, we woke up, dismantled our camp, and with our hefty backpacks back on, we considered last night's pants incident and decided to find a different route to descend. We discovered a path that appeared to involve fewer slippery rocks but instead required us to leap from one huge rock to another. In one particularly challenging section, John accidentally dropped one of his panniers into a cave, and when I dropped my backpack for him to catch, it hit him in the face. It was quite comical. After about an hour, covered in sweat and dust, we finally descended.

Taking a bath in the nearby mountain river was an immense relief. The water was incredibly cold and revitalizing. Since it was upstream from the town, it also seemed clean. While I washed some of my clothes and myself, John nearly got carried away by the current, bumping into rocks until he managed to grab hold about 10 meters downstream. I didn't witness this, but I believe his crazy story!

Feeling refreshed and clean once again, we returned to the road to resume hitchhiking.

Now, this was our introduction to the van taxis. Before long, a van heading to Churin stopped, coincidentally our destination as well, and we eagerly hopped in. The van made several more stops, picking up numerous passengers along the way. Upon arriving in Churin, much to my dismay, I observed everyone giving the driver 10 soles. Reluctantly, we did the same and resolved not to take any more of these vans—ha, how naive we were, as we'd soon find out the next day.

But for the present, it was past 1 PM, and being in the mountains, John recalled his past experiences hiking in the French Alps when it typically rained after this time, sometimes accompanied by intense lightning storms. Hence, we chose to set up camp then and there. We ascended to a grassy plateau above the road and pitched our tents. Despite the area being filled with dry grass, we were undeterred from building a fire. We dug a substantial pit, fortified it with stones all around, and even used mud as cement. Afterward, we cleared all the grass in the immediate vicinity around the fire pit, military style.

Not long after we had kindled the fire and got it burning, just as John had predicted, it started raining. Initially a light trickle, it quickly escalated into a downpour. I didn't have a poncho and the thought of sleeping in damp clothes in the chilly mountain environment was unappealing. I sought refuge inside my tent until the rain subsided, which fortunately happened after about an hour. Once it stopped, we reignited the fire and cooked up an amazing meal—pasta with tuna and rocotto sauce. Life felt good with the harmonica's music lingering in the air, and we exchanged campfire songs late into the night.

The following morning, as we broke camp and hit the road, we managed to hitch a few exhilarating rides with some locals, covering about 5km each. But as we ventured toward Oyon, our luck faded. The road wound steadily uphill, reaching heights where Oyon, nestled in the Andes, actually experienced snow. Taxi vans passed us intermittently—one, then two, then three. After hauling our packs uphill like donkeys for over two hours, with only these vans for company, we reluctantly flagged down the next one. Camping near Oyon, high up in the Andes without adequate warm clothes or even a ground mat, didn't seem appealing. We had no desire to face a freezing nightmare.

Reaching Oyon, we hastily devoured some food at a local cafe and hurried to depart. As the city faded from view, vast fields unfurled before us. We were descending from the Andes, leaving behind the desert landscape of coastal Peru. Now, fertile plains, tall trees, and stunning forests stretched out before our eyes. It was a breathtaking sight.

In fact, so breathtaking that I started to get a bit dizzy just looking at it. As we kept on walking, the dizziness intensified, and it was even painful to look at the brightness of the day, as the light seemed too strong, whitening my eyes. What was happening?

- Do you feel it? - I asked John.
- Yeah - he said. - The effect of high altitude and low oxygen content.
- Indeed - I concurred - and coupled with the fact that we are walking doesn't really help. Let's take a break and prepare some mate.

The mate did help. Or maybe it was just the rest. In any case, after this short break, we got one of the most incredible rides yet, in the back of an old pickup, and that, along with descending down the mountains, was simply incredible. We sipped mate and watched the view of the plains and fields far below us cruise by. This was an amazing ride.

This ride came to an end at a tiny farmhouse by one of the plains, apparently belonging to the driver, and we continued walking from there. It was still extremely high in the mountains as we arrived at a small truck outpost, where trucks seemed to be leaving one after another. There were about 20 trucks parked in that area, and the road ahead wound up rapidly in ascendance.

Climbing up that road, a truck slowly crawled past us, and I gave the driver a thumbs up in a regular hitchhiking manner. He signaled to me that he's going to stop further up the road. So I set off running after the truck. John tried to do the same but fell and nearly dipped his face in a puddle of snowy water (Yes, we were still that high in altitude!). Eventually, I caught up to the truck.

- Your friend is coming? - asked the truck driver.
- Yes, he's just behind, gotta wait for him - I replied.

Once John arrived, covered in mud, we got in, and the trucker generously drove us a significant distance across a dirt road filled with innumerable potholes. My rear end was singing as I sat on some metal cover on the bunk bed. Apparently, this was John's first experience with a truck, and he seemed to enjoy it. An important step in every hitchhiker's life - achievement unlocked: successfully hitch a truck.

The trucker was headed to Cerro de Pasco, not exactly on our route. So, we got off at the intersection of Ruta 100, which went off to Cerro de Pasco, and our own Ruta 18. It was literally in the middle of nowhere. The nearest town of Chinche was about 100km further still. The scenery once again was breathtaking. Fields and plains sprawled around, and alpacas were grazing on grass. Soooooo many alpacas! Naturally, we started chasing them around the field, laughing like maniacs, as they ran from us at full speed, probably thinking about how weird humans were. I ran out of breath pretty quickly, but John spent a good 10 minutes chasing them around and seemed to be pretty satisfied and happy with himself.

Not long after, a ride was offered in a semi full of fertilizer. I sat in the front with these two dudes in the cabin, and John lay in the back on top of huge bags of fertilizer.

- I felt like an illegal immigrant - he said in retrospect.

Luckily, the ride wasn't long, and it took us to about 10km away from Chinche. Obviously, the guys asked for money. `For gasoline`, they say. Everybody here asks for money. I didn't give them any.

We resumed our walk, and along the way, I managed to snatch a few strands of Aloe Vera. Before long, we reached the town, an extremely tiny place with a population that couldn't have been more than a few hundred.

- Gringoo! - shouted one local as he drove past us on a motorbike.

As we strolled through the town, we noticed the locals whispering among themselves, giggling, and then beginning to follow us. After a quick stop to get some water at a local kiosk, we stepped out and found ourselves surrounded by them.

- Where are you from? Can I take a photo with you? Why are you here? Where are you going? - they bombarded us with questions, extremely excited. I don't think they've ever seen foreigners passing through Chinche before in their lives.
